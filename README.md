# C-programs
Some C programs I coded by myself mostly <br />
store_management.c , ITEM.H need to be downloaded and run together. The output is shown in the screenshot of store_management.png <br />
My friend needed help with this so I decided to help him code since I knew basic C from 1st semester of my course. It's just a fun code - anyone can use it if they want but don't take credits.
